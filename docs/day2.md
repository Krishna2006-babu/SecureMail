# Backend Foundations – Day 2 Complete Notes  
**Project:** SecureMail  
**Focus:** Node.js, Express, Server, APIs, Request–Response

These notes contain all important theory and practical understanding
required for Day 2 of backend learning.

## 1. What is Backend?
Backend is the part of a web application that runs on a server and handles:
- business logic
- authentication and authorization
- data processing
- communication with the database
- security

Backend receives requests from frontend and sends appropriate responses.

## 2. What is Node.js?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run
outside the browser.

### Why Node.js is used
- JavaScript can be used for both frontend and backend
- Non-blocking and event-driven architecture
- Suitable for scalable web applications

Node.js is required to create backend servers using JavaScript.

## 3. What is npm?
npm (Node Package Manager) is a tool that comes with Node.js.

### npm is used to:
- install third-party libraries (like Express)
- manage project dependencies
- share and reuse code

Example:
```bash
npm install express

  4. What is Express?

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js framework
used to build backend applications and APIs easily.

Why Express is used

Without Express:

creating a server is complex

handling routes is difficult

With Express:

server creation is simple

routing is easy

request and response handling is clean

Express acts as a layer on top of Node.js.
